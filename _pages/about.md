I am a senior Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, within the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), with Prof. Christopher M. Proctor. My current work focuses on short-pulse laser-based microfabrication of advanced bioelectronics and development of electronically controlled drug delivery flexible systems, especially for the treatment of neurological disorders. As first member of a newborn research group in Oxford, I have taken on a role of coordinator of different projects in bioelectronics and I contributed to establish new cutting-edge facilities in the Old Road Campus Research Building and the [Botnar Research Center](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/about/botnar-institute-for-musculoskeletal-sciences).   

I obtained my Master degree cum laude in Materials Engineering and Nanotechnology from the [University of Salento](https://international.unisalento.it/) (Lecce, Italy) and a PhD cum laude in Materials and Structures Engineering and Nanotechnologies at the [Center for Biomolecular Nanotechnologies](https://cbn.iit.it/) of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT). During my PhD, I worked on a great variety of topics, in particular on the design and fabrication of ultrathin electromechanical transducers and nanogenerators for energy harvesting from water and wind sources, and for sensing on the human body, based on Aluminium Nitride (AlN) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). Nanogenerators based on new devices, new approaches and new designs were proposed and analysed, resulting in ten first-author article contributions and 1 book chapter.

As a Postdoctoral Scientist at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (EPFL) and at [Campus Biotech](https://www.campusbiotech.ch/en) (Geneva), supervised by Dr Yves Leterrier and Prof. St√©phanie P. Lacour, I worked on optoelectronic neuroprosthetics and encapsulations for implantable biomedical/bioelectronic devices. I developed a novel universal method ([Magnesium test](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.202315420)) to quantify accurately the barrier performances of thin-film encapsulations for implants, in real time and in situ. This patented method has been demonstrated in five high-impact research papers.

I am an engineer with a solid background in materials science and nanotechnologies for electronic and biomedical applications. I have a proactive attitude and results-oriented mindset: among my peculiarities there is the capability of accomplishing high-quality deliverables within tight deadlines. 
I belong to the Italian Professional Body of Engineers and I am Standard-Bearer of Labour of the Italian Republic.
